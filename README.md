# Machine-Learning
Install the library using pip install pycaret

PyCaret is an open-source machine learning library for Python that reduces your time from preparing the dataset to test the model.
Using PyCaret, preparing the data is simple. We can use a function called setup from the pycaret.classification library.
One of the main features of the PyCaret library is that you can run any machine learning model at the same time, ranging from Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, XGBoost, and many more!
with just one function, compare models() you can get all model results at the same time!
reproduce the best model from the obtained result 
Improve it by doing hyperparameter tuning. Hyperparameter tuning is a process where we pick the best hyperparameter from all hyperparameter combinations.
Now predict and save the model for future use on different projects.
